    "It is clear that among the free iOS English apps, more than a half (58.65%) are games. Entertainment apps make up 8.23%, followed by photo and video apps (4.11)%. Only 3.52% of the apps are designed for social networking, followed by education apps which amount to 3.25% of the apps in our data set.\n",

I must also note that this designation is somewhat subjective given that some apps may be commonly used for fun but certain users may use them for productivity. For example, influencers may use social networking apps for both fun and practical uses, similar to how musicians may use music apps for both uses. For this reason I've created an Other category and tried to think of mass use to determine classification.  \n",

    "This niche seems to show some potential. The reviews show some consistency for the first 8 most popular apps. The App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests that the market might be saturated with for-fun apps, making it difficult to compete with. As a result, a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "One suggestion is to make an app that takes popular books and includes features in supplement to the raw version of the book. This could include a summary of the book, a discussion of controversial topics in the book, daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, commentary from the author of the book, quizzes or crossword puzzles and games about the book, etc. Additionally, I could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users can access definitions without needing to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other genres that seem popular include: weather, book, food and drink, and finance. The book genre overlaps with the app idea I described above, and reinforces the potential possibility for user engagement in our suggested app. In addition, I will not focus on those apps in my recommentation because of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Weather apps:</b>  generally, users don't spend too much time engaging with the app. As a result, the chances of making a profit from in-app adds are low. In addition, getting reliable live weather data may require the app to connect to non-free APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Food and drink:</b>  examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. Therefore, making a popular food and drink app may require an established cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Finance apps:</b>  these apps involve banking, paying bills, money transfer, etc. Building a finance app requires domain knowledge that I would refer to a financial expert which adds more expenses and additional research. This is also outside the scope of this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I will analyze the Google Play market.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Google Play market, the data includes the number of installs, so genre popularity should be more evident in this column. Unfortunately, the install numbers don't seem precise enough — most values are open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.):"

    "In this project, I analyzed free available data on the App Store and Google Play mobile apps. My goal was to make an analysis to support my recommendation of an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "I conclude that given the lack of dominant competition and because of the popularity of language, library, and other learning and education related applications, a reasonable recommendation for a new app seeking user engegement would be to develop an app that will provide the user with access to desireable information in written, audio, visual and interactive form, in the reference genre. For example, it may be profitable to take a popular book (perhaps a recent bestseller, Booker Prize winner, one that has been adapted into film or TV, or a \"classic\") and develop an app that incorporates new and various ways for the user to engage with its content. Because both markets have multiple libraries, there is a need to add some special features to supplement the raw version of the books or information. This could include: better marketing, branding and user-interface, commentary from the author, embedded dictionary, highlighting and comment tools, summary, reviews, analysis, daily quotes from a book, an audio version of a book, crossword puzzles or quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, an interactive bookclub feature, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, creating an app in this way may result in favorable ratings and user engagement, which could translate in ad revenue."
